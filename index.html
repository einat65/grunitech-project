            <h2 class="title">Habima- a place I enjoyed visiting</h2>
    
            <p>
                In 1958 the Israeli government led by David Ben-Gurion declared Habima to be Israel’s national theatre.<br/>
                The same year, Habima was awarded the Israel Prize for its significant contribution to Israeli culture and society.<br/> 
                From Habima’s beginnings in Moscow as a professional Hebrew theatre, to its immigration to the land of Israel, to the construction of its theatre hall<br/>
                in Tel Aviv and its establishment as Israel’s national theatre: this is the story of how the vision of a small group of Jews who dreamed of acting in the Hebrew<br/>
                language turned into Habima Theatre - the National Theatre of Israel.
